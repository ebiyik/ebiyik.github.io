<!--<p style="margin-bottom:0; color:#ED7D31; font-weight:bold;">I will be joining the department of Computer Science at the University of Southern California as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2023!</p><br />-->

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">I am an assistant professor in <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. I lead the <a href="https://liralab.usc.edu/">Learning and Interactive Robot Autonomy Lab (LiraLab)</a>. Broadly, I am interested in artificial intelligence for robotics. In my research, I use tools from machine learning, artificial intelligence, optimization, game theory, robotics, information theory, and cognitive science. Specifically, I work on robot learning from humans, human-robot collaboration, and learning in multi-agent systems.</p><br />
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Prior to joining USC, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley's <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/">CHAI</a>, working with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/">Prof. Stuart Russell</a> and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anca/">Prof. Anca Dragan</a>. I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I was advised by <a href="http://dorsa.fyi">Prof. Dorsa Sadigh</a> in <a href="http://iliad.stanford.edu/">Intelligent and Interactive Autonomous Systems Group (ILIAD)</a>. I spent Summer 2021 as a research intern at Google, working with <a href="https://research.google/people/106512/">Dr. Yinlam Chow</a>, <a href="https://mohammadghavamzadeh.github.io/">Dr. Mohammad Ghavamzadeh</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~cebly/">Prof. Craig Boutilier</a>. I got my B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering at Bilkent University, where I conducted research in <a href="http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cukur">Prof. Tolga Ã‡ukur</a>'s lab.</p><br />
